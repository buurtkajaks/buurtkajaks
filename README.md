# Development

This repository has been forked from [crwn-clothing-v2](https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/crwn-clothing-v2/tree/main/src). I created a development branch that branches out from the main branch from this repository. It is important you checkout to the development branch before you proceed.

# Installation

## Install dependencies

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

## Set your firebase config

Remember to create a .env file with the config variables from the firebase dashboard! The .env.example file serves as an example. To get your firebase config variables, navigate to the project settings gear icon > project settings and scroll down to the config code.
